# Codid-19 Vaccination-in-Argentina
In this project, I used data from the Ministry of Helth from Argentina http://datos.salud.gob.ar/dataset
Using Power BI, I developed key visualizations to understand the vaccination camping in 2021 and valuable Inisghts from it.
First, divide by location, gender, age range, types of vaccines and number of applications.
With these parameters in mind, I developed measures to get more in depth information such as the porpuse of vaccination and wich brands of vaccines used.
In my country Argentina, they used a lot of Russian and Chinese vaccines due to friendship between the countries and still don't have a deal with Pfizer for example.

Key things to note: There is not as much difference between Male and Females vaccination, the group that got more vaccines are those of 65 or older age and the main two locations with more vaccines provided are CABA and Buenos Aires province (because of the amount of people living in it)
The project is in Spanish but a version in English is going to be available too.
